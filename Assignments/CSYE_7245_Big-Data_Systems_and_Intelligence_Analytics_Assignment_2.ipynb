    "Continue with your data from assignment 1 or use your project data. You will perform regression, binary clasification and multiclass clasification. If your data is not appropriate for regression, binary clasification or multiclass clasification you must find one or more Kaggle datasets for  regression, binary clasification or multiclass clasification.  \n",
